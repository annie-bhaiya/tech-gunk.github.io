                <p>I am a simple boy, if you think this, it is false; I have always been trying, from my childhood to learn all the best things possible. I started learning music, as my first hobby when I was 6 years old, with a little casio. But now, I
                    play multiple keyboards at a time, produce music, play an arranger piano, play harmonium and sing.<br> I started learning chess in the age of 8. I always used to get defeated by my mother but when I started to practice more, I recieved
                    a prize in the game at city level in the age of 12. <br> I also have played carrom, swimming and skating. I got selected in rounds and have 9 medals in skating and 2 in carrom.<br> My latest and the most min-freshening hobby is "computering".
                    You know what it means? Hah! I love typing stories and articles on my PC. I love playing video games, programming, creating videos, audios, and editing images, audios and videos. I did this computer-starting on 1 JULY, 2020. And on
                    the day I am writing this paragraph is May 25, 2021. As computer science has grown so much within 90 years, my computer knowledge has also grown within 1 year. THANK YOU</p>
